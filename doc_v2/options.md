## Options descriptions

**Note:** this is still under development.

### `separateWordSearch` option
When it set to `true`, if a searching string contains several words, it splits the string by spaces into separate words and highlights individual words instead of the whole string.  
It also applies to every string in a searching array.

When it set to `'preserveTerms'`, it preserved term(s) surrounding by double quotes from breaking into separate words.  
This allows highlight exact term(s) alone side with individual words.  
It can be pretty useful, when library is used to highlight searchings or in case of using a string instead of an array and there is need to keep some term(s) intact.

It also allows highlight quoted terms no matter how many quotes it contains on each side (but not in the middle),  
e.g. `""term""` - marked `"term"` or `""""term"` - `"""term`.

### `exclude` option
In the case if the context contains element(s) matches in which shouldn't be highlighted, the `exclude` option can be pretty handy.

``` html
<section>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor</p>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor</p>
    <p>Lorem <i>ipsum <b>dolor</b></i></p>
</section>
```
``` js
new Mark(document.querySelector("section")).mark("Lorem dolor", {
  // Note: to exclude all descendants, you need to add 'p:last-child *' selector
  exclude: 'p:last-child, p:last-child *'
});
```

### `accuracy` option


``` js

```
